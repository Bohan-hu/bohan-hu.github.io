== Tools

- PCC: MLIR-Based Compilation Framework for Photonic-Electronic Accelerators
-- Created an end-to-end compilation framework for neural networks using MLIR and LLVM for photonic-electronic accelerators
-- Utilized MLIR to automate the mapping of high-level DNN specifications to photonic hardware architectures
-- Demonstrated up to 4x speedup on DNN workloads compared to traditional hand-crafted implementations using custom optimizations
-- Positioned the framework as a foundational tool for developing novel photonic circuit designs for real-world AI applications.

- FIONA: Full-Stack Photonic-Electronic Architectural Simulation Framework
-- Designed an ISA for photonic-electronic collaborative processor
-- Implemented a baseline vector processing unit (FIONA-V) compatible with photonic computation circuits
-- Capable of simulating photonic circuits with the electronic counterparts. 

== CPU Cores

- A RISC-V Processor Core running Linux \M [https://github.com/Bohan-Hu/RV-Lite-OSOC \[Code\]]
-- Designed a 3-stage pipeline including (1) instruction fetch, (2) decode & execute and (3) commit & exception handling
-- Implemented Translation Lookaside Buffer and hardware Page Table Walker to support hardware virtual memory management
-- Implemented AXI interface to integrate the core into SoC that work with peripherals (DDR controllers, Ethernet, etc.)

- MIPS Out-of-Order Superscalar Processor on FPGA \M [https://github.com/Superscalar-HIT-Core/Superscalar-HIT-Core-NSCSCC2020/blob/master/design_doc.pdf \[Doc\]] \M [https://github.com/Superscalar-HIT-Core/Superscalar-HIT-Core-NSCSCC2020 \[Code\]] \M [https://github.com/Superscalar-HIT-Core/Superscalar-HIT-Core-NSCSCC2020/blob/master/presentation.pdf \[Slides]]
-- GShare / TAGE overriding branch predictor, with a 256-entry Branch Target Buffer and a 16-entry
-- Next Line Predictor
-- Pipeline flushing on branch misprediction and precise exception handling
-- 2 integer units, 1 pipelined multiplication and division unit and 1 pipelined load/store unit, with grouped bypass network
-- 4KiB 4-way instruction cache with Pseudo-LRU replacement policy and 16KiB non-blocking data cache to avoid stalling the load/store pipeline on cache misses
-- Use ROB to force the MMIO access seen in order
-- Explicit register renaming to handle WAW, WAR hazards
-- Exceeded the 40x IPC than Loongson GS132 (single-issue, 3-stage pipeline) on crc32, select sort, 30x on sha, stream copy
-- RTL design using Verilog, synthesis and implementation using Vivado, with target frequency 88 MHz on Artix-7 FPGA
